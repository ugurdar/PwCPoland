# whyR-PwC Hackathon 2021

This repo consists the script, data and readme file of the submission for hackathon implemented by Ugur Dar and Mustafa Cavus.

Our motivation is to propose new classifier method to maximize accuracy based on optimal cut-off value approach. The optimal 
cut-value is obtained by a search algorithm is 

merge of the title and venue of the paper in same text. Then the similarity values are 
calculated by using Jaro-Jinkler distance of the texts considered to be similar. To classify the texts whether 
are matched, a cut-off value based approach is proposed. This approach searches an optimal cut-off value to maximize the accuracy 
of the proposed classifier.
