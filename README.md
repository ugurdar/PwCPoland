# whyR-PwC Hackathon 2021

This repo consists the script, data and readme file of the submission for hackathon by Ugur Dar and Mustafa Cavus.

Our motivation is to merge of the title and venue of the paper in same text. Then the similarity values are 
calculated by using Jaro-Jinkler distance of the texts considered to be similar. To classify the texts whether 
are matched, a cut-off value based approach is used.
